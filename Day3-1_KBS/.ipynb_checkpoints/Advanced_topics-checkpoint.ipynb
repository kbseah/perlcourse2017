    " * Updating code is easier - if you decide to square instead of cube, you only have to change it at one place vs. three\n",

    "```\n",
    "    my ($in) = @_;\n",
    "```\n",

You can imagine that `@_` is behaving like a miniature `@ARGV`, but instead of acting for the entire script, it is only valid within that subroutine. If you have more than one subroutine, each one has its own `@_`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above line assigns the contents of `@_` to a new array called `($in)`. Why the brackets around `$in`? Remember that `@_` is an array, so you should not have `my $in = @_;`. Alternatives: `my $in = $_[0];`, `my @in = @_;`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice the `my` command here. The variable `$output` is only defined within this subroutine. Outside of this subroutine, in the main code body, you can have another variable called `$output` which would not be affected. Likewise, if you try to call `$output` outside of this subroutine, it would return an error message. This is what is meant when we say that `$output` is **lexically scoped** to this subroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might recall seeing something similar with variables that are used in loops or if-else conditions.\n",

    " * Bear in mind that the special variable `@ARGV` is always an array, even if the user only supplies one argument! \n",
    " * Arguments in that array are separated by spaces by default. You can't use commas, or dashes, or other fancy stuff.\n",
    " * Arguments aren't necessarily just filenames. They are simply text strings that your script has to process later. It's up to you to tell the user what they should be!\n",
    " * If you want fancy stuff, with switches like Unix programs (e.g. the `tar` example shown above), you should use the modules [`Getopt::Std`](http://perldoc.perl.org/Getopt/Std.html) and/or [`Getopt::Long`](http://perldoc.perl.org/Getopt/Long.html) (I recommend the latter)."
