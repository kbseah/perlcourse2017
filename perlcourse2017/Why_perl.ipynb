    "# Why Perl?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is for biologists who want to pick up some basic scripting skills, and we've decided to teach it in the language Perl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Perl, and not some other programming language like Python or C? \n",
    "\n",
    " * We are most familiar with Perl, and we can only teach what we know....\n",
    " * For many simple scripting tasks - where all you need to do is to shuffle some text around, search through files, reformat some tables - Perl is *good enough* and has a natural, English-like syntax\n",
    " * It's an interpreted language - scripts can be written and executed \"out of the box\" without being compiled into binaries, unlike C for example\n",
    " * We expect that most students in this course would already have experience with writing shell scripts for `bash`, and probably also using regular expressions with the standard Unix tools `grep`, `sed`, and/or `awk`. Perl is very similar to these scripting tools, especially `awk`, and so it is a good place to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Perl is good for\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing and manipulating text-based data\n",
    " * Most bioinformatics data are fundamentally just text: Fasta, Fastq, SAM, GFF, Genbank etc. are all text files\n",
    " * A lot of headaches in bioinformatics are caused by format conversion - i.e. processing text, which is what Perl is good at\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tying together other programs / languages\n",
    " * Perl is what you turn to if your bash scripts are getting out of hand\n",
    " * From Perl you can easily call external programs, redirect their output, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "### Having more than one way to do the same thing \n",
    " * This means that you can choose between more human-readable syntax when you are striving for clarity, and more arcane shorthand when you just need one line of code to fix something quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being ubiquitously available\n",
    " * Virtually all modern Unix-type operating systems, including Mac OS X, are shipped with Perl, so you can rely on it to be there on any computer you use (versions for Windows are also available)\n",
    " * A lot of bioinformatics scripting has been done in Perl, so it's useful to be able to read other people's code\n",
    " * Modules written by other people, such as the very useful Bioperl module, can be readily downloaded from the CPAN archive\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Perl is not good for\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing data that is not text, e.g. images, audio\n",
    " * There are libraries for this sort of thing, but you're better off looking elsewhere, \n",
    " \n",
    "### Having more than one way to do the same thing\n",
    " * Blessing and a curse - Perl allows you to write very cryptic things that can be difficult for other people to understand. And among \"other people\" you should also count yourself a few weeks or months in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being the flavor of the moment\n",
    " * Times change and trends move on - if more people write code in Python, and software that you need to use is written in Python, then you have to learn Python eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Having a real-time interpreter\n",
    " * Dude if you really want to learn Python just go take a Python course already"
