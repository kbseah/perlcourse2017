## Outline

### Day 1
 * Why Perl? What Perl is good for (and what it's bad for) (KBS)

### Day 2

### Day 3

## Materials

I've drafted some code that I want to demo using Jupyter notebooks, which can also be exported as HTML or PDF to distribute as handouts (marked under learning objectives above). Sorry if I've staked out a topic that you want to cover - just let me know if you've already got something in mind and we can swap topics. -- Brandon

KIV: Have to cleanup terminology of "function" and "operator" in the Jupyter notebooks
