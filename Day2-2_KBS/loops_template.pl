# I love thee ...
my @ways = ("to the depth and breadth and height / My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight / For the ends of being and ideal grace",
            "to the level of every day’s / Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light",
            "freely, as men strive for right",
            "purely, as they turn from praise",
            "with the passion put to use / In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith",
            "with a love I seemed to lose / With my lost saints",
            "with the breath, / Smiles, tears, of all my life",
            "and, if God choose, /I shall but love thee better after death");
